# Gmail Subaddress Tagging

This script automatically tags and archive incoming emails in Gmail based on the recipient's subaddress.

## Example

If you receive an email at `username+bank@gmail.com`, this script will tag the email with the `bank` label.
If no subaddress is detected emails will be tagged as `untagged` by default
